# Mental-Fitness-Tracker
 A mental fitness tracker is a tool or application designed to help individuals monitor and manage their mental well-being. Similar to how a physical fitness tracker tracks your steps, heart rate, and other physical activities, a mental fitness tracker focuses on tracking and improving aspects related to mental health and emotional well-being.
